			<p>A <em>Hugin Network</em> here is a network file describing a problem to be solved with
				Bayesian reasoning. Hugin is a popular Bayesian modeling and inference engine from Hugin Expert.
				From the Hugin API manual:
				<blockquote>
					The HUGIN API contains a high performance inference engine that can be used as the 
					core of knowledge based systems built using Bayesian belief networks or “limited memory” 
					influence diagrams (LIMIDs). A knowledge engineer can build knowledge bases that model 
					the application domain, using probabilistic descriptions of causal relationships in 
					the domain. Given this description, the HUGIN inference engine can perform fast and 
					accurate reasoning.
				</blockquote>
				</br>
			<p>In CertWare we do not use the commercial Hugin inference engine, but rather we use a
				publicly-available sensitivity analysis and inference engine called <em>SamIam</em> from the UCLA
				Computer Science department (see the reference at the left).  
				While SamIam can perform the Bayesian network computations using 
				Hugin NET files as input, it is not intended as a complete replacement for Hugin.  However, 
				SamIam does support the probabilistic analyses that are most useful for safety cases, and can 
				perform other tasks such as sensitivity	analysis and value-of-information calculations.  
				CertWare will add these tasks in the future. 
			<p>CertWare represents the Hugin Network (NET) metamodel in a domain-specific language (DSL).  The
				CertWare NET DSL implements nearly all of the NET grammar described in the Hugin API manual (see
				the references at left).  The DSL implements syntax checking and some validation of content.  More
				validation rules will be added in the future.  To create a NET file, simply create a file
				with the extension <b>.net</b> or use the New File wizard and choose NET file.
			<p>The NET DSL editor is shown in the figure.</p>
				<img src="images/net/net-edit.png" alt="NET DSL" width="100%">
			<p>After the network model is complete, one can perform some <a href="bayes.html">Bayesian
				Reasoning</a> queries on the network in the Network Analysis view.

			<p>When creating a new NET file in the workbench, CertWare populates the file with a template
				that shows most of the correct structure for a typical model.  Use this template to
				edit the problem to be computed in the workbench.
