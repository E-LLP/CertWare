			<!-- <p><img src="images/cwlogo.png" alt="" width="180" height="165" class="image" /></p> -->
			<p>The software assurance evidence metamodel (SAEM) is an OMG-provided standard that CertWare uses as the basis for 
				more specific evidence models (see also the companion <a href="arm.html">ARM</a> metamodel).  As described
				in the OMG specification (see reference at left):
				<blockquote>
					In the simplest form, evidence consists of a collection of documents that provide evidentiary 
					support to a set of claims. These claims are called subject claims, as the are made by an argument 
					related to some selected subject area. We will differentiate subject claims from evidence claims, 
					which are claims about the evidence items that help establish the exact nature of the evidentiary 
					support they provide to subject claims in a crea, comprehensive and defensible way. Evidence 
					arguments are reused as opposed to subject domain claims and arguments, which are specific to 
					each subject domain. The evidence vocabulary describes claims made about evidence. Evidence 
					vocabulary is reused in every argument for various diverse domains.
				</blockquote>
				  
			<p>CertWare intends to build specific evidence model types derived from this metamodel, but
				no such models have yet been implemented.  The analyst can, nonetheless, produce evidence
				models directly in SAEM.  CertWare provides only a text-based structured tree owing to little containment usage in the metamodel.
