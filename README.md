CertWare is a collection of plugins and features for Eclipse.  The CertWare software is provided under a NASA open source license agreement.
One can employ these features within another Eclipse runtime configuration, or package them as an Eclipse product. The web site pages in this ```gh-pages``` branch provide some introductory material and user's guides.
