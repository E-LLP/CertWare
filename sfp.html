			<h2><a name="introduction"/><em>Semi-Formal Proof</em> Arguments</h2>
			<!-- <p><img src="images/cwlogo.png" alt="" width="180" height="165" class="image" /></p> -->
				<p>A <em>semi-formal proof</em> is a proof structure in which the overall arrangement of a proof 
					is a formal data structure, while individual propositions within the structure are 
					expressed either formally or informally. The motivation is to make the proof easier 
					to review by human readers, while preserving some automated verification capabilities.
					The language is designed in such a way that the human review is as simple as possible, 
				showing only the related premises and inferences necessary to support a deduction statement
				requiring validation.  This approach minimizes the clutter and confusion of validating the
				proof.

				<p>Although SFP models have not traditionally been employed in safety case applications, we
					feel this novel approach offers some compelling benefits.  We will be developing some templates
					for using SFP models in a way that would be familiar to a safety case author or reviewer, 
					and will offer these through the CertWare workbench.
					  
			<p>The CertWare implementation of SFP is through a domain-specific language (DSL).  The SFP DSL
				provides an editor with syntax checking and built-in validation rules.  Just create a file
				with the extension <b>*.sfp</b> or use the New File wizard to create an SFP file.  To enter
				a proof (a form of safety case), start by entering a theorm statement which is the top-level
				claim of the case.  Then, on each subsequent line, enter a line number for idenfication 
				followed by an hypothesis, entailment, or simple statement.  A statement must provide
				a justification using a parenthetical list of statement numbers following the statement; these
				are then the justifications upon which the statement depends.  After entering the proof, run
				the <b>Review Wizard</b> to launch a wizard that walks the analyst through the proof
				step-by-step, prompting him to validate the inference made in each step.  The analyst can
				mark the statement as valid, invalid, or unknown, and these states will propagate through
				the rest of the proof.  When all of the statements are valid according to the analyst, 
				we can say the proof is valid.
				   
				<p>The following automated verification rules are built-into the SFP DSL editor.  When found to be invalid,
					the rules generate markers on the proof file resource and in the editor. 
					<ul>
						<li>Each justification must be non-empty.</li>
						<li>A proof must have at least one proof step.</li>
						<li>A proof cannot contain cycles.</li>
						<li>A statement justification cannot refer to itself.</li>
						<li>A justification identifier must exist.</li>
						<li>An entailment tail identifier must exist.</li>
						<li>Each entailment head identifier must exist.</li>
						<li>An entailment statement cannot include itself in the head or tail.</li>
					</ul>
