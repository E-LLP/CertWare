			<p>After the analyst creates a <a href="net.html">Hugin Network</a> describing the 
				problem domain he will want 
				to perform some queries on his network model.  We use the SamIam inference
				engine to support the query calculations.  CertWare provides a Network Analysis view which
				shows the selected network resource file as a structured tree, where the network variables
				are the branch nodes and the variable states are leaves on each node.  Each variable or
				state is selectable with its checkbox.  To assert evidence, click on the corresponding state
				(these are mutually exclusive in the editor).  To select variables for queries, click on
				their checkboxes.  The following figure shows this Network Analysis view with a model selected.  
				The view is also included in the CertWare perspective.

			<p>To save evidence selections for future application, CertWare provides an evidence metamodel
				and editor.  The view can create an instance of this model with the current evidence selections,
				prompting the user where to save the file in the workspace.  To recover and apply evidence saved
				earlier, simply restore the evidence in the selected model.  If the model has changed structure,
				or evidence is applied to a different model, only variable and state matches that succeed will
				be applied.  While it is not necessary to use the evidence model editor, one is available in the
				workspace (perhaps for generating permutations for testing), and is shown in the following figure.

			<p>To perform queries in this Network Analysis view, assert the evidence selections, if any, and 
				select the variables of interest for the query results.  The toolbar buttons will respond
				to selections, as will the corresponding items in the view's menu.  The queries available
				at this writing are the <i>maximum a posteriori probability</i> (MAP) and 
				<i>most probable explanation</i> (MPE) calculations.  To set up the inference engine
				preferences see the Network Analysis view's preference page. 
				<center><img src="images/net/net-preferences.png" alt="Net Pref" width="60%" border="1"></center>  
			<p>The MAP calculations determine the most likely state of world for each selected MAP variable 
				given the evidence.  It computes both p(MAP,e) and p(MAP|e), and can use either approximate 
				or exact values; the approximate methods are most appropriate for large models as the exact 
				algorithm complexity is exponential. The MPE calculation is a special case wherein all of the 
				nodes with unobserved values are selected as MAP variables.  In this case only p(MPE,e) is relevant. 
				The following figure shows a sample MAP calculation result as shown in the Network
				Analysis view.  Use the section header buttons to expand or collapse sections of interest.
				Note there is currently a bug in the display of the search time units of measure.

			<p>Finally, the following figure shows a sample MPE calculation result on the same model.

			<p>When creating a new NET file in the workbench, CertWare populates the file with a template
				that shows most of the correct structure for a typical model.  Use this template to
				edit the problem to be computed in the workbench.
